The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#very-special .special div {
  color: green;
}

#very-special div {
  color: purple;
}
```

The `#very-special div` selector has higher specificity than `.special div`, even though `.special div` appears to be more specific.  This is because the ID selector (`#very-special`) carries significantly more weight than the class selector (`.special`).  The order in which the stylesheets are linked is not relevant here because of the selector's specificity.
